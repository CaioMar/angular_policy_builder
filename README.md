# Policy Builder (Angular Prototype)

This is a minimal Angular prototype for the policy builder UI. It includes a small Graph Editor component that lets you add nodes, connect them with edges, edit simple node properties, and export/import JSON and DOT.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd /home/caiomartins/Workspace/policy-builder-app
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

Notes
- This is a prototype scaffold. For a production-ready editor, we'll add richer graph edit controls, undo/redo, DOT parsing with `graphlib-dot`, simulation runner, and persistence.
